# calc-kata-5
Prompt  OK let's make a calculator app plain-vanilla JS, DOM APIs, no client-side libraries  however, use modules on the client side if you can remember how server-side -- vanilla express is OK log every time you have to google something when done put the code into your private channel -- as github repo (edited) start with addition and layer on the other 3 basic operations if you have time also if you have time make the calculator not look like crap

# google log
- nothing to report

Much smoother transitions now.  I feel comfortable enough to advance to a more difficult prompt. Specifically learning the fetch api at this time.  Hopefully being able to serve up routes for a semi complex applet.
